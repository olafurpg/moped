Hello world! I'm excited to announce the release of Moped, a new Scala library
to build robust, feature-rich and extensible command-line applications. You may
be thinking that there are so many command-line parsing libraries out there, why
create another one? It's a fair question and this post is my attempt to explain
the motivation to create Moped.

Moped was created based on my experience of building the command-line tools for
[Scalafmt](https://scalameta.org/scalafmt),
[Scalafix](https://scalacenter.github.io/scalafix),
[MDoc](https://scalameta.org/mdoc) and
[Fastpass](https://github.com/scalameta/fastpass). None of those command-line
tools currently use Moped, but they all share logic that has been copy-pasted
from project to project. The honest answer for why Moped exists is that I want
to stop copy-pasting large amounts of code every time I create a new
command-line application.

I have tried to use alternative libraries such as
[Scopt](https://github.com/scopt/scopt) (still used by Scalafmt),
[case-app](https://github.com/alexarchambault/case-app) (was used by Scalafix
for a long time) and [Picocli](https://picocli.info/). These libraries work
great for what they're advertised to do but in my particular use-cases I have
needed additional features:

- **Low-boilerplate**: after using scopt for Scalafmt I observed that it
  required a lot of manual work to introduce a new command-line argument. This
  worked fine while I was the only contributor in the project but as soon as
  other people started sending PRs I noticed it took me a long time to review
  code because changes to the command-line interface always required
  copy-pasting setting names and flags to multiple different places like the
  configuration parser and the website documentation.
- **Fast compile-times and comprehensible compile errors**: after using case-app
  for Scalafix I observed that it took a long time to compile my command-line
  interface and I spent a lot of time struggling to troubleshoot cryptic compile
  error messages. While I loved the low-boilerplate API of case-app, I didn't
  feel productive.
- **Idiomatic Scala**: after evaluating Picocli for my next command-line
  application I decided not to use it because it doesn't feel idiomatic when
  used from Scala. This is the most subjective "requirement". For example, it
  didn't feel gratisfying to provide default option values for int flags via
  strings. If you're looking to build a command-line application, you should
  seriously consider using Picocli because it looks really good.

There are many other command-line parsing libraries such as
[Scallop](https://github.com/scallop/scallop),
[twitter/util](https://github.com/twitter/util),
[Apache Commons CLI](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-cli/) and
[Decline](https://github.com/bkirwi/decline). I have not used these libraries in
a serious capacity but I have heard good things about them. You should
definitely consider using these alternatives if you're building a Scala
command-line application. But first, let me try to explain the features that
make Moped unique in my opinion.

Here are some of the features that
